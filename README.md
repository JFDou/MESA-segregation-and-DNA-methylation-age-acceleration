**Background**: Neighborhood racial segregation and poverty may be important drivers of health inequities. Epigenomic factors, including epigenomic clocks, have been implicated in the link between social factors and health. We sought to test DNA methylation, an epigenetic factor, for association with exposures to segregation and poverty.  

**Methods**: In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, census tract (as proxy for neighborhood) measures of segregation and poverty were assigned based on participant residence at exam 1. At exam 5 (an average of 10 years later), DNA methylation was measured in blood samples enriched for monocytes for 1102 participants. We calculated DNA methylation age acceleration using four clocks trained to estimate either chronological age or physiological dysregulation. Using linear regression, we tested the link between tract segregation or poverty and DNA methylation age acceleration. 

**Results**: For Black participants, living in tracts with greater clustering of Black residents was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration. A one standard deviation increase in segregation was associated with 0.41 years GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration (p<0.001); this association was not observed with other clocks. This association was particularly pronounced for participants living in highly segregated or high poverty tracts. For Black and Hispanic, but not White participants, tract poverty was associated with GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration.

**Conclusion**: Segregated and poor neighborhoods have been associated with numerous chronic conditions and epigenomic mechanisms may play a role.
